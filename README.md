# WeGoWayBack
Way back machine data visualizer.

This code and following scripts assume the following:
- unix like os
- python 3.9.7
- pip 21.3.1

First time running the code use:
- source ./install
This will set up the python virtual environment and install all the python
packages required by this website and then launch the website.

If changes are to be made to the code:
- source ./activate
This is useful for needing to quickly re-enter the virtual environment if it 
is already installed.
